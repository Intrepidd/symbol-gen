# symbol-gen package

Adds a shortcut to generate ctags symbols file for your project.  After you generate this file
you will be able to find symbols across your project using `cmd-shift-r`.  Symbol-gen uses
the configuration [found here](https://github.com/atom/symbols-view/blob/master/lib/.ctags) by default.  However, you can use your own settings by adding
them to `~/.ctags`.

###Shortcut

Hit `cmd-alt-g` to generate tags file for your project.
